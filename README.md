## About the game  

Zsírozás is a traditional Hungarian card game where the goal is to win tricks and capture specific cards.  
It is played with the same deck described above.  

## Features  

* Interactive Gameplay: Play Zsírozás with Hungarian cards.  
* Score Tracking: Real-time updates for both players.  
* Classic Rules: The game follows traditional Hungarian Zsírozás rules.  

## How to Play  

The goal of the game is to collect as many "zsír" cards (aces or tens) as possible through your tricks during the game.  
There is no trump suit in the game, and except for the two "zsír" cards, which are worth ten points each,  
the cards have no point values or ranks. The less-known name of the game, "Sevens," refers to the fact that in this game,  
the otherwise worthless seven can capture any other card.  


At the start of the game, each player is dealt four cards, and after every round, one or more new cards are dealt  
(depending on how many cards were played during the round). Players can start the game with any card.  
A challenged card can only be captured with a card of the same value.  
The seven (VII) is a special card because it can be used to capture any challenged card as if it matched its value.  


A challenged card can be captured multiple times. For example, if the starting player opens with a ten and another player captures it,  
the starting player can continue with a new round and recapture the played cards again, possibly multiple times.  
Ultimately, the pile goes to the player who plays the last card that matches the challenged card or a seven.  


The player who takes the trick starts the next round.  


The winner is the player who collects the most aces and tens during the game.  
In a two-player game, this requires a minimum of five cards.
